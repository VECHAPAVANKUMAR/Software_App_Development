My website consists of mainly 4 pages which are named as Home, About Me, Projects and Contact Me.

In order to traverse from one webpage to the another I used a navabar which is responsive and Hence
this navbar is available in all of my webpages.

I also included the footer section which consists information regarding the copyrights of this website and
Hence this footer is also available in all webpages.
